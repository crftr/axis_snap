axis_snap
=========

Surveillance cameras are easy to work with, relatively speaking.  Video management systems (VMSs) are not. VMS software is usually a ball of licenses and incredibly quirky to the uninitiated.

This application was born from the need for camera snapshots every minute.  The snapshots are batch stored locally in zip files.

## Compatibility
As a Windows service, it is only compatible with Microsoft Windows.  It's written in C# with .NET 2.0 -- it's safe to assume compatibility with any server running Windows 2003 or newer.

axis_snap only supports AXIS encoders at this time.
